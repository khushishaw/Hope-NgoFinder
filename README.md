# HOPE_NGO_FINDER
An app that would enable the user to find an Ngo according to specified location as well as choosing the issue that they would like to volunteer for. 



## Getting Started
This is prototype that we have created for the Solution challenge where we are trying to propose a solution for one of 17 sustainable goals defined by united nations i.e peace ,justice and srtrong isnstitution.
This app is to aware people about intown authenticated and registerd Ngo so that it is easy for them to work for a good cause .
It also has a special feature that informs user about volunteer activities and various campaign which are conducted by NGO's .Our goal to make this app was to spread goodness to helpless people in our society and also to aware others and make it convenient for them so that they are motivated to work for a good cause 

### Future Expectations 
Our journey for this cause do not end here,our future goal is to add a feature to the app where people can just register for donations on our app and delievery agent will collect it from them and drop it it to the required location.
People these days our so busy in their lives that even if they want to do something for the needy they can't just because of their busy schedule and in this race of life some are even forgetting to work for good so the convenience from our app will actually motivate them to help the needy which will generally fulfill our goal of PEACE.
